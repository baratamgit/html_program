Tag vs elements:
for eg:
h1 element - <h1>content</h1>
anchor element - <a>content</a>
elements are nothing but content with tags. tags can be open 
or close
There are two types of elements.
i.inline : inline elements allows next elements to beside them.
ii.block: block elements doesn't allow any elements to beside them.
they always comes in new line
eg: headings, p, lists, table, semantic elements

General block element -- div
General Inline eleemnt -- span
/* make an image and anchor tag and make them come in 
different lines using block / inline general elements*/
<img src="" alt="" />
<div><ahref="">click me</a></div>

semantic elements:
There are some elements which are used to make search engine understands 
our code easily. They are called semantic elements 
eg: header,main,footer,nav,aside,section,article,figure
but they won't create any impact in UI.
