HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
    HTML is used for the structure / skelton of a web page. 
    HTML started by tim Berner's Lee.
    GML ---> SGML ---> HTML. current version of html is HTML5
    HTML consists of tags. Tags are represented in two ways 
i. open tag(<tagname>)
ii. close tag(</tagname>)
--> whole HTML code is between HTML open and close tags.

--> HTML contains two elements such as head and body. 
Head also contains Title

--> we can generate basic templete using emmets such as !+enter, html:5+enter

--> The gap on left of elements to make code more readable is known indentation

Task1: write a comment stating it is your first html, create html template with proper 
indentation,give proper title and print in body, hello world
